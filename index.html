                <p>
                    Hi, I‚Äôm Paul - a Kenyan full-stack software engineer based right here in Kenya. I‚Äôm soft-spoken, 
                    easy to get along with, but don‚Äôt let that fool you. I‚Äôm sharp, creative, and deadly serious when it 
                    comes to delivering clean, functional, and exciting code. Stick around to see what I‚Äôve built, 
                    how I think, and why I might just be the guy you want on your team.

                <h3>What‚Äôs in my toolbox?</h3>
                <p>
                    I work across the full stack - front-end, back-end, and everything in between. Here are some of the tools I‚Äôm fluent in:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Languages:</strong> Java, Python, JavaScript</li>
                        <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML, CSS, JS</li>
                        <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Node.js, Express</li>
                        <li><strong>Databases:</strong> MongoDB, MySQL</li>
                        <li><strong>Other tools:</strong> Git, GitHub, Postman, VS Code</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    I love learning new technologies, but I‚Äôm also big on mastering the fundamentals. Code that works is good - code that lasts is better.

                <h3>What have I built?</h3>
                <p>
                    From side projects that scratched a curiosity itch to full-on applications that solved real problems, I‚Äôve been busy. I‚Äôve grown 
                    from junior dev to someone who can plan, build, and ship solid products end-to-end. Take a scroll through my <a href="https://github.com/Polceze" 
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Open my Github on a new tab">GitHub</a> - there‚Äôs a bit of everything: clean code, clever 
                    solutions, and more than a few late nights behind it all.

                <h3>From Physics to Full Stack</h3>
                <p>
                    Would you believe I didn‚Äôt study software development in university? 
                    I hold a BSc. in Physics from JKUAT. My pivot into tech came through the <a href="https://www.powerlearnprojectafrica.org" 
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Open Power Learn Project Africa website">PLP (Power Learn Project)</a> Software Engineering Scholarship - and 
                    that decision changed everything. Since then, I‚Äôve been deep in this world: learning, building, breaking stuff (on purpose), and building again.

                <h3>When I‚Äôm not coding...</h3>
                <p>All work and no play? Not me. Here‚Äôs how I keep life interesting:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Road trips</strong> ‚Äì I love to drive. For me, a vacation starts when the engine turns on, not when I arrive.</li>
                        <li><strong>Amateur piano</strong> ‚Äì Self-taught and powered by instinct. I build chords by ear and it‚Äôs one of the most rewarding things I do.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Curious browsing</strong> ‚Äì I‚Äôm a YouTube deep diver. I‚Äôm into anything that questions what we think we know - from mind-bending theories 
                            to the ‚ÄúWas the moon landing faked?‚Äù kind of debates. I don‚Äôt always believe them, but I‚Äôm always curious.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    As you might‚Äôve noticed, these hobbies aren‚Äôt just fun, they help me reset and come back to work with fresh ideas. They‚Äôve taught me patience, creativity, 
                    the value of consistent practice, and the habit of questioning common solutions - all of which come in handy when I‚Äôm deep in code, solving tough problems.
